# Todoey ✓

## Our Goal

The objective of this tutorial is to understand how to save data in iOS. We'll look at various choices and learn to use UserDefaults, Core Data and Realm.


## What you will create

A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.

## What changed

Since course is old some pods are not working. For colors used CyaneaOctopus pod.
For navigation bar color changes created GlobalAppereance file to have Global Tempate to use in AppDelegate and per-instance function to use in controllers to change color based on category color.

Also Realm is deprecated but used it to follow the course but will use SwiftData for future projects.
